# Welcome to CE 4363/5363 Groundwater Hydrology

These are the instructor course notes (from which lecture and discussion items are derived).

The environment itself is a [Jupyter{Book}](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) (an interactive on-line notebook, although the interactive part is not working on my server(s) yet).

:::{note}
Many (but not all) underlined/bold items are working hyperlinks to the resource.  Some take you to paywalls, others to the actual item.  You should follow these hyperlinks as you examine these notes.

## Syllabus
The syllabus is located at [ce-4363-2023-1-syllabus](http://54.243.252.9/ce-4363-webroot/0-Syllabus/ce-4363-2022-3-Syllabus.html).

## Other resources
Other resources are located in the various parts of the course server; hence the admonition to follow hyperlinks.

## Code Blocks
Many examples are presented either in $\textbf{R}$ or $\textbf{iPython}$ and will appear as "verbatim code" like:

```
e = mc^2
```

Or as functional code blocks.  In either case you can cut-and-paste onto your computer (assuming it is configured correctly) and run the examples at your leisure.
