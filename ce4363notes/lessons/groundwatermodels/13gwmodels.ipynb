    "A confined aquifer (pressure aquifer) is one bounded above and below by impermeable formations.\n",
    "In a well penetrating such an aquifer, the water level will rise above the base of the confining formation.\n",
    "Water levels in wells that sample a certain aquifer define an imaginary surface called the piezometric surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unconfined aquifer (water table aquifer; phreatic aquifer) is one with the water table as its upper boundary.\n",
    "The classifications are important because the equations of motion are different in different kinds of aquifers.\n",

    "## Storativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Storativity of an aquifer is the relationship between changes in head within the aquifer and the quantity of water stored in the aquifer.  The dominant mechanism of storage is different for confined and unconfined aquifers. {numref}`storage` is a sketch depicting the storage process in a confined, and an unconfined aquifer.\n",

    "In a confined aquifer the water is stored or released by compression and decompression of water and the solid matrix (like a sponge squeezed while wrapped in plastic wrap).  In an unconfined aquifer the water is stored or released from the pore space when the water table elevation changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The storage coefficient (confined) or specific yield (unconfined) is the volume of water added to (or removed from) storage per unit area of aquifer per unit change in head.  The usual symbols are $S$, and $S_y$.\n",
