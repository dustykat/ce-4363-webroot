    "\n",
    "Before our journey into the fascinating world of aquifers and their kin, we need to define a water table, which is the the locus of points in a porous medium where the pore water pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure (pg. 98).  One particularly important type of aquifer is a water table aquifer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful heuristic guidelines regarding water table behavior are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the absence of groundwater flow (discharge, recharge, reversed charge), the water table will be flat (no meaningful gardient)\n",
    "2. A sloped water table indicates that groundwater is flowing\n",
    "3. Groundwater discharge zones tends to be in topographic low spots\n",
    "4. The water table shape often mimics the surface topography (unless engineers have their way!)\n",
    "5. Groundwater tends to flow away from topographic high spots and towards topographic low spots, but not always\n",

The arithmetic mean is not usually useful, in part because $K$ is not normally distributed (or even symmetrically distributed; negative values are meaningless), typically the median and geometric mean are used.\n",

    "## Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage is the term used to describe how much water is contained in an aquifer.  \n",

    "There are three principal mechanisms of storage always present, but of differing relative contribution:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. compression/decompression of the water, and\n",
    "3. compression/expansion of the solids structure.\n",

    "1. porosity (specific yield), and\n",
    "2. bulk compressibility of water, and\n",
    "3. bulk compressibility of the solid structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unconfined Aquifers** primary storage mechanism is draining/filling of the pore space in the vicinity of the free surface.  The other two mechanisms are relatively insignificant, even at large scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confined Aquifers** primary storage mechanisms are compression/expansion of the solids structure and compression/decompression of the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term matrix compressibility refers to the phenomenon where the solids rearrange so that matrix porosity changes with changes in head.  Draining/filling of pore space is insignificant (as long as the aquifer remains confined the same volume of aquifer is saturated)\n",
