# # Computational Tools
# 
# Most computations related to Groundwater Hydrology can be accomplished using a computer spreadsheet such as Excel or LibreOffice.  Similarly, Jupyter Notebooks running a python kernel work well too, as does the **R** kernel.
# 
# Complex groundwater modeling is professionally accomplished using accepted software such as **MODFLOW** akthough for pedagogic reasons, a bit of time is spent homebrewing simpler instances of such models.
# 
# For homeworks Excel is sufficient, but show some sample calculations to explain each row in a spreadsheet.  Readers who are comfortable using Jupyter will find some advantages there.  
# 
# The section on models presents three (3) alternative methods to build and run MODFLOW models.
