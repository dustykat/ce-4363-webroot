# 
# This section presents a few "classical" steady flow solutions in a couple of useful geometries.
# 
# ## Steady Flow 1D Cartesian
# 
# ### Confined Aquifer (pp. 143-145)

# 
# 1D flow in a confined aquifer can be solved by direct application of continunity and Darcy's law.  For example consider:
# 
# ### Unconfined Aquifer (pp. 145-151)

# 1D flow in an unconfined aquifer can be solved by direct application of continunity and Darcy's law.  For example consider:

# **Solution Sketch**
# 
# Apply continunity (or actually the unconfined flow equation)
# 
# ![](unconfined-with-recharge-002.png)
# 
# Then analysis (e.g. calculus) to find the result sought.
