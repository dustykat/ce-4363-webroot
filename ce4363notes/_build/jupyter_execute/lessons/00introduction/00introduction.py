# ## Homework
# 
# The homework assignments are accessed via BB which links to HTML pages on this server.  The assignments are intended to reinforce material in the lectures and book.
# 
# Each problem can be cut-and-paste (as an image most) into a Word document (or LibreOffice).  Then for each problem provide
# 
# - Given: (usually just the problem statement is sufficient, but you should get in the habit of listing given values) Text & symbols & vaules to describe scope
# - Find: unknowns and units
# - Scoring rubric (kind of):
#  - (1/2 credit): identify the appropriate symbolic equations
#  - (1/4 credit): connect problem statement to those equations (known/unknown)
#  - (1/4 credit): complete solution - algebra, calculations, scripts.  Present answer with units and **highlight the answer**.
#  
# If you choose to wirte on engineering paper, and scan into PDF, be sure your work is legible and organized (**not brain vomit**) and the scanned file is readable.  If I can't read it, it won't get assessed!
# 
# - Start each problem on a new page (its a electronic document)
# - Work in order down page
# - Number pages
# - Put your name on document (cover page or header is fine), put initials into the filename
# - Save/print as PDF
# - Upload to blackboard
