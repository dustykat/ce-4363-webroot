Derive the equation that relates head in the aquifer to the recharge ($N$) and the position ($x$).  The water level in the left drain is fixed at elevation $h_L = 10.0$ meters.  The elevation of the land surface is $D=18.5$ meters.  If the right drain is one kilometer from the left drain and the desired minimum depth to water is $d_{min} = 1.0$ meter, find the required elevation of water, $h_R$, in the right drain.  The recharge rate is $N=0.001 \\frac{m}{day}$, the hydraulic conductivity is $K=1.0 \\frac{m}{day}$\n",
